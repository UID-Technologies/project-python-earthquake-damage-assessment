## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Option A: Build Locally (for testing)

```bash
# Windows
.\build-and-push.bat latest

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x build-and-push.sh
./build-and-push.sh latest
```

When prompted to push, choose "No" for local testing only.

### Option B: Build and Push to Docker Hub

```bash
# Windows
.\build-and-push.bat v1.0.0

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x build-and-push.sh
./build-and-push.sh v1.0.0
```

When prompted:
1. Choose "Yes" to push
2. Login with username: `varungupta2809`
3. Enter your Docker Hub password
4. Wait for push to complete

### Option C: Use Docker Compose (development)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts both the app and database!
